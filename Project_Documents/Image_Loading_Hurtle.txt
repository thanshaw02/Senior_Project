Issue I ran into that I could bring up in my presentation:

First, when trying to load images for all the locally saved plants I tried to store them into my SQLite database as a BLOB. But I 
quickly realized that each individual row in my table had too much data for the SQLite cursor to deal with. There's a 2MB max on data 
per row, and if exceeded an exception will be thrown.

Next I tried keeping the photos in my Firebase cloude storage instance, and would instead hold the last part of the file path for each 
photo in my local SQLite database. I'd instead get the photo from my Firebase storage when it's needed in my RecyclerView. But this to 
proved to not be feasible, because with a RecycleView as View's are moved off screen they are destroyed and recreated again when they 
they appear on screen. This means that as the user scrolls up and down the RecyclerView I'm constantly make calls to my Firebase storage,
so my images would either take a second to load or be in the wrong spot due to some weird logic when destroying and recreating the Views.

I instead settled with using a 3rd party library called Glide. Glide makes loading images, either locally or remotely, seamless - and adds
some really cool customization and optimization. So what I ended up doing is storing the URL connected to each photo in my Firebase storage
into my local SQLite database (when getting data from my local database I create a new instance of a Plant for each row, therefore 
storing each URL in a Plant instance locally). Then when displaying each photo in my RecyclerView I would use Glide to load each photo 
useing the stored URL in each Plant instance.

Here's what I did with Glide:

Glide.with(this@PlantDatabaseFragment).load(plant.getPlantPhotoUri())
                .diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.RESOURCE) // This allows Glide to cache the images locally
                .into(plantImage)

Where "plantImage" is an Imageview in my layout, and "plant.getPlantUri()" is the URL that poinst to that plants photo.

Cool stuff!! Bring this up on Thursday?
