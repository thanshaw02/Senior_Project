Plant Selection UI:

Plant Name: 
	- They can start typeing the common name in and it will sort of autofill the rest for them based onn what they are type??
	- Also have a button to the left of the ET that allows them to open up the local database and choose that way??

Plant notes??:
	- Possibly let the user leave some notes about their find??
