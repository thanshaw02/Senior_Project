# CS_480
Folder for all of my CS 480 files, will use this remote repo to work on my senior project

My senior project was an Android app that helps you keep track of plants and fungi found outside. I use the Google Maps API so you can pin plants you have found on a map, making it easy to find them in years to come. You can also take pictures of plants you've found which can help you identify them easier later. I use Firebase for login authentication and also the Realtime Database as my user and plant database.
